	<h1>Contrasting Concepts of Harmony in Architecture: The 1982 Debate Between Christopher Alexanderand Peter Eisenman</h1>
	<h2>An Early Discussion of the "New Sciences" of Organised Complexity in Architecture </h2>
	<h2>Christopher Alexander and Peter Eisenman</h2>
	<p><cite><a href="http://www.katarxis3.com/Alexander_Eisenman_Debate.htm" target="_blank">ALEXANDER, Christopher; EISENMAN, Peter. Contrasting concepts of harmony in architecture. Lotus International, v. 40, p. 60-68, 1983.</a></cite></p>

	<h2>Editors’ Introduction</h2>
	<p>This legendary debate took place at the Graduate School of Design, Harvard University, on November 17<sup>th</sup> 1982. Not long before it, Alexander had given a talk on <i>The Nature of Order</i>, which was to become the subject of his <i>magnum</i> opus of architectural philosophy. The original version he envisaged was less than half the size of the final four-volume work as it now stands, but its main ideas were already formulated.</p>
	<p>Before the debate Eisenman had listened to the tape of Alexander's talk &ndash; one of the first public presentations of the ideas in <i>The Nature of Order</i>. What followed was thus partly shaped by those ideas. What ensued can be said to represent an historic occasion: Alexander is presenting his basis for the New Paradigm in Architecture at the same time as Eisenman presents his competing, diametrically opposed, deconstructivist claim for such a Paradigm.</p>
	<p>The importance of the debate has been widely recognised. Twenty years later, the Harvard Graduate School of Design republished it alongside three other seminal documents from the post-1969 period: an early piece by Alexander Tzonis on the &ldquo;end of ideology in architecture&rdquo;, excerpts from a 1994 conference on &ldquo;De-naturalized Urbanity&rdquo;, and a recent debate on urbanism between Rem Koolhaas and Andres Duany. Some people may only have heard of the 1982 encounter because Alexander said Eisenman was &ldquo;fucking up the world" in a public forum; but if this is all one knows about it, one is not prepared for the generally good-natured tone of most of the exchanges.</p>
